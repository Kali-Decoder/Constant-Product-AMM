Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are essential to the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem because they facilitate trading and liquidity provision. The Constant Product AMM, which powers well-known decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and SushiSwap, is a fundamental idea in this field.

In this blog, we'll examine theConstant Product Automated Market Maker and explore the arithmetic involved in introducing and withdrawing liquidity.
The basic principle behind Constant AMM is the constant product formula, which ensures that the product of the quantities of two tokens in the pool remains constant.
Working Principle
The Constant AMM works on the following equation:

x * y = k


Where:

x represents the quantity of Token A in the liquidity pool(CPAMM).

y represents the quantity of Token B in the liquidity pool(CPAMM).

k is a constant value that remains unchanged during swaps (until liquidity is added or removed).
